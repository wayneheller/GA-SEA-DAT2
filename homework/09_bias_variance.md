## Class 9 Pre-work: Bias-Variance Tradeoff

Read this excellent article, [Understanding the Bias-Variance Tradeoff](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html), and be prepared to **discuss it in class** on Thursday.

**Note:** You can ignore sections 4.2 and 4.3.

Here are some questions to think about while you read:
* In the Party Registration example, what are the features? What is the response? Is this a regression or classification problem?
   

* Conceptually, how is KNN being applied to this problem to make a prediction?
   

* How do the four visualizations in section 3 relate to one another? Change the value of K using the slider, and make sure you understand what changed in the visualizations (and why it changed).


* In figures 4 and 5, what do the lighter colors versus the darker colors mean? How is the darkness calculated?


* What does the black line in figure 5 represent? What predictions would the best possible machine learning model make, with respect to this line?
  

* Choose a very small value of K, and click the button "Generate New Training Data" a number of times. Do you "see" low variance or high variance, and low bias or high bias?


* Repeat this with a very large value of K. Do you "see" low variance or high variance, and low bias or high bias?


* Try using other values of K. What value of K do you think is "best"? How do you define "best"?


* Does a small value for K cause "overfitting" or "underfitting"?


* Why should we care about variance at all? Shouldn't we just minimize bias and ignore variance?
